This is a very simple and quick bread made using this recipe: https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/classic-sandwich-bread-recipe from King Arthur Flour.
Made according to the recipe except with (the same amount of) brown sugar instead of white. I think this caused the bread to be sweeter than the recipe and possibly not
as much of a rise. It also could probably have done with some more kneading. But it turned out quite well.

Here is the dough just before going in the oven:

Update:
I made this for a second time, this time with white sugar, a slightly higher and wider silicone loaf tray, and added a slash to the top and some seeds. It could possibly have done with a shallower slash, but it turned out well, was very soft and fluffy and great for sandwiches. ![alt text](../images/sandwich_bread_2_collage.jpg "Collage of KAF sandwich bread second attempt")
